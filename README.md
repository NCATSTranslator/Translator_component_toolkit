# Translator component toolkit (TCT)

## What is TCT?
Translator Component Toolkit is a python library and related jupyter notebooks allowing users to explore and use KGs in the Translator ecosystems. 

## Key features for TCT
Allowing users to select APIs, predicates according to the user's intention. <br>
Parallel and fast quering selected APIs.<br>
Providing reproducible results by setting contraints.<br>
Allowing testing wheter a user defined API following a TRAPI standard. <br>
Faciliting to explore knowledge graphs from both Translator ecosystem and user defined APIs.<br>
Connecting large language models to convert user's questions into TRAPI queries. <br>

## How to use TCT
Please follow the example notebooks below to explore the Translator knowledge providers.

## Three utilities
#### Connection finder
Example notebook for **[connection finder](./notebooks/Connecting_userAPI.ipynb)**

#### Path finder
Example notebook for **[Path finder](./notebooks/Path_finder.ipynb)**

#### Network finder
Example notebook for **[Network finder](./notebooks/Network_finder.ipynb)**

#### Connecting to a user's API
API should be developed following the standard from [TRAPI](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI). 
An example notebook for add a user's API can be find [here](./notebooks/Connecting_userAPI.ipynb)
**Warning: It does not work if no user' API is established**

## Requirements
Please follow the **[requirements](./requirements.md)** to be able to run all the notebooks.  

## Contributing
TCT is a tool that helps to explore knowledge graphs developed in the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium. Consortium members and external contributors are encouraged to submit issues and pull requests.
